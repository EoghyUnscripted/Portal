# The Hulbert Files
# Portal
# Author: Eoghan Hulbert
# Version: 1.0

This Django project was built to serve multiple web apps in one as a demo portal. Users would access by signing up 
or logging in to access a personal portal. Each portal account allows users to utilize the apps without overlapping 
data with other users and provides a level of security to prevent malicious intent.

In this project I have built:

1) To-Do App
2) Tip Calculator
3) Recipe Manager - Coming Soon!

While I prefer to separate projects to their own repo, I chose to combine these separate apps together to demonstrate
how I am able to create and understand scaleable software design.

At this time, the Portal is not currently hosted online for demo purposes due to lack of traffic of the website.
However, users can clone the repo and set up a local environment to explore on their own.
